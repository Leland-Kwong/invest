Investment framework for life and business

## Philosophies

* [Start with Why - Simon Sinek](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en)
* [Competition is for losers - Peter Thiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fx5Q8xGU8k)
* Mitigate emotional decisions
* Invest in the long-term
* **Time** in the market is better than **timing** the market - For stocks that you are bullish about, quite often when you wait for dips to buy, those dips don't come for awhile and you end up missing all the returns that you could have had if you just bought it immediately. Even if you do manage to catch the dip, the overall discount relative to the long-term growth is quite small in comparison. 

## Questions you should ask yourself before making an investment choice

* [ ] Why am I investing in this?
* [ ] Are there any strong competitors? 
* [ ] Will this decision make a lasting impact on society?
* [ ] Would I be proud to work for this company?
* [ ] Am I willing to invest for the long-term, say 5, 10, 15+ years?
